# Weather-Dashboard

This project is a weather dashboard backed by Openweather API and OpenUV API. The user enters a city in the search bar. Upon clicking the search button a button with the city name is dynamically created. Once the user pushes the button with the city name the current weather conditions appear in the maindashboard. The UV index is color coded to indicate the severity of the UV rays in that area (so be sure to wear sunscreen). A 5 day forecast also displays beneath the main dashboard. The user will be able to search for multiple cities and click between the buttons that are created to show the appropriate information.
